# Function Programming with Python

## What this is about:

  Having lately got back into Data Science, I actively practise coding in Python. Among the different topics I got to study, one of them was the application of Functional Programming with Python. Previously, while I was coding in JavaScript, I was gettig confident with the application of this paradigm in JavaScript. I was curious how Functional Programming will interact with Python and decided to create this repo as a playground.
