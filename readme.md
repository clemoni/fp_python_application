Having lately got back into Data Science, I went back to actively practise coding in Python.   Among the different topics I got to study, one of them was the application of Functional Programming with Python. Previously, while I was coding in JavaScript, I was started to be confident with the application of this paradigm in JavaScript. I was curious how Functional Programming will interact with Python and decided to create this repo as a playground.
